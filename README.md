# MTW_Project Risk Management
Web Engineer Master Thesis Work

The project implements a solution for the management of project risks, a web application for the identification, analysis and control of risks that can occur in a project. The objectives are to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of negative events for the project.

The system will feature different planning stages for risk management, identification of risks, will also feature some methods to perform both qualitative and quantitative analysis of risks, producing a planning possible response of the risks and monitor and control them.
This tool aims to be used for the replacement of documents that exist today, for the subjects of the Master of Web Engineering as for the Degree of Computer Engineering Software; these subjects are about Risk Management, facilitating the work of both students and teacher.

Some of the technologies used for the project are using the MVC architecture model with Struts2 and Spring, where the view, it would presentation logic, using JSPs that produce HTML; the driver would be to call to Struts2 action class, through HTTP requests and finally the model with data access components using for this Spring, JavaBeans to encapsulate data and DAO patterns to store the data in the DB, each layer would be communicated between them through the application Façade pattern, using the interfaces between layers. Once registered the data in the database they are addressed in the application and converted by a library called IText in PDF documents.
